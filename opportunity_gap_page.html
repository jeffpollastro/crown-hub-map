    <!-- What Economically Disadvantaged Means -->
    <div class="narrative-section">
        <h2>What the Numbers Mean</h2>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <strong>"Economically Disadvantaged"</strong> refers to students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch under the National School Lunch Program. A family of four qualifies at a household income of roughly $55,500 or less (185% of the federal poverty line). When a school shows 49% economically disadvantaged, it means nearly half of its students come from families where paying for groceries is a daily calculation &mdash; let alone $1,500-$5,000 per season for AAU basketball.
        </div>
        <p>On the mountain, that 49% average is spread across every school. There is no wealthy neighboring district to absorb the cost or subsidize programs. In the Valley, high-poverty districts like Allentown (91%) sit next to affluent ones like Parkland (23%) &mdash; and all of them are within 20 minutes of multiple AAU programs, YMCAs, and training facilities.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Infrastructure Investment -->
    <div class="narrative-section">
        <h2>The Mountain Is Investing — But Facilities Alone Aren't Enough</h2>
        <p>Pocono Mountain School District has committed nearly <strong>$4.9 million</strong> to gym and athletic facility upgrades in recent years. East High School received a <strong>$1.49 million gymnasium renovation</strong>, and West High School opened a brand-new <strong>$3.38 million Wellness Center</strong> — a 12,900 square-foot facility with a full basketball court, volleyball markings, concessions area, and athletic trainer's suite.</p>
        <p>These investments show the district values athletics. But a renovated gym without year-round programming is just a building. Without structured off-season development, competitive leagues, and accessible pathways, the mountain's girls still have nowhere to grow as basketball players — no matter how new the floor is.</p>

    <!-- The Real Problem -->
    <div class="narrative-section">
        <h2>Beyond the Data: What We See on the Ground</h2>
        <p>The numbers tell part of the story. The rest plays out in gyms, living rooms, and transfer paperwork across the Poconos every year:</p>
        <p><strong>Parents aren't championing basketball year-round.</strong> Many families expect coaches to develop their daughters entirely within the regular season. When schools hold open gyms in the off-season, attendance is minimal. The culture of year-round development that Valley programs take for granted does not exist here.</p>
        <p><strong>Varsity-level girls prioritize work over basketball.</strong> In economically disadvantaged households, a part-time job isn't optional &mdash; it's survival. Girls who could be developing their game are instead working shifts, because no one has built a local pathway that makes basketball worth the tradeoff.</p>
        <p><strong>The best players leave.</strong> Girls who do excel and find their way into competitive basketball often join Valley AAU programs out of necessity &mdash; there is nothing for them here. And the ones who develop into standout players? They transfer to private institutions like Bethlehem Catholic, which has built one of the region's strongest girls programs. The mountain develops talent, then watches it walk out the door.</p>
        <p><strong>Girls aren't watching basketball.</strong> Without local role models, competitive programs, or visible pathways, girls on the mountain aren't growing up as basketball fans or aspiring players. The pipeline doesn't just leak &mdash; it was never built.</p>
